# INNOVAI – AI-Driven Automation Systems for Digital Businesses

🚀 **INNOVAI** is a full-stack automation framework built to empower digital service providers — including online course creators, law firms, and clinics — by automating customer support, lead capture, and conversion flows through intelligent, modular systems.

This project is a fusion of **software engineering, system architecture, and strategic business automation**, created and maintained by [@Dawitlior](https://github.com/Dawitlior). Every tool and component in this project is handcrafted, tested, and deployed with scalability and real-world performance in mind.

## 📊 Macro-Crypto Investment System

In parallel to business automation, the creator of INNOVAI has developed a **personal macro-crypto strategy framework** that operates on top of:

- 📈 **Custom-built trend-following systems**
- 📊 **Multi-layered global liquidity cycle analysis**
- 📐 **Relative strength modeling over 70+ crypto assets**
- 🧠 **SDCA (Strategic Dollar Cost Averaging) overlays**
- 📑 **Signal aggregation dashboards** fully engineered in Google Sheets

This is a structured system that blends on-chain data, macro cycles, and intraday-state synchronization – coded, refined, and operated entirely in-house.
